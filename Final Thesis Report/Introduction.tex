\section{Introduction}
\subsection{Context \& Motivation}
%Introduce most of the concepts around money in electric transportation/urbanization/environmental aspects from the presentation, e.g. "why is this needed"
\subsection{Changing Cities}

By 2050, it is projected that 86 \% of the developed world will reside in urban areas \cite{Economist}. 
As a result of the adoption of the motorized vehicle, cities have become increasingly multi-centred, with retail parks and industrial estates far removed from the city centre \cite{SustainableTransport}. 
As a result of the changing layout of modern cities, traditional public transport has been rendered largely ineffective at efficiently transporting the population within the city \cite{SustainableTransport}. 
A British study showed that 83\% of commuting trips and 90\% of business trips in that country involved only a single passenger in a car \cite{NTS}, highlighting that the supply of mass, group transit does not meet the travel demands of modern society.
\\
\\
The lack of effective transportation infrastructure also has a considerable impact on the environment. 
The United States Environmental Protection Agency has determined that 14\% of global emissions are as a result of the transportation sector \cite{EPA}. 
Meanwhile, a Belgian case study showed that 47\% of trips and 54\% of distance travelled in that country was for the purpose of urban commuting \cite{Belgium}. 
Clearly, the environmental impact of urban transportation is considerable.

It has been determined that an effective transportation system for a modern city must satisfy the following constraints \cite{SustainableTransport}:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item is available on demand
	\item goes non-stop from start to destination
	\item is easily accessible and offers a full choice of destinations
	\item is strongly environmentally friendly
	\item is low cost
	\item integrates well with other forms of transport
	\item has demonstrably high safety together with personal security
\end{enumerate}

Personal electric transport (PET) has the potential to satisfy the transportation demands of a modern city. 
PET is user operated, meaning it is indeed available on demand and is accessible. 
Additionally, it is inherently portable and thus integrates well with other forms of transport. 
Using an appropriate power source will ensure that the PET device can travel non-stop to and from a multitude of destinations at a low cost. 
In order to ensure personal security and safety, it is imperative that the PET device have a stabilizing mechanism governed by control law. 
A RipStik makes for an ideal candidate in the study of control law for complex mechanical systems for use in personal electric transport. 


\subsubsection{The RipStik}

A caster board, known commercially as a RipStik, is a two-wheeled, human powered vehicle. 
The board is similar to a skateboard; however, it features two platforms, each with a wheel connected to an inclined free spinning caster. 
These platforms are connected by a torsion bar. 
This gives the caster board rider the unique ability to generate propulsion without removing their feet from the board through a series of small turns. 
This configuration also allows for tighter turning and more responsive speed control when compared to a skateboard.

Developing an electronic control system for the RipStik could facilitate riding, reducing the learning curve associated with the board while preserving the advantages of the vehicle.
However, a RipStik is a sophisticated mechanical system and will require complex mathematical modelling to understand and represent all forces present in the system at a given time. 
As a result, comprehensive testing and design metrics are required as there are no implicit assumptions to be made about the device's operation. 
The technology developed in modelling and controlling the RipStik can be applied to a large variety of systems. 

The addition of a control system to a complex mechanical system presents the potential for significant conflicts. 
Aside from the challenges associated with the development of the mathematical model and control system, issues pertaining to the patents for transport systems \cite{casterboardPatent} and restricted operation of certain devices \cite{TOLaws} may represent a barrier in bringing theses products to market. 
Additionally, a mechanical system will be required to execute the commands of the control system. 
The difficulties associated with the recycling of batteries \cite{BatteryRecharge}, housing \cite{PlasticAssessment} and motors may threaten the environmental feasibility of the final design. 
The system may also be susceptible to "hacking" by outside sources \cite{DEFCON}, which could pose a significant safety risk to the operator. 
If these issues are addressed and mitigated, the potential of the device to minimize injuries associated with operating complex mechanical systems and to serve as a viable alternative to motor vehicles can be realized. 
This area of study has the potential to redefine urban commuting across the world by introducing a safe, cost-effective and environmentally-friendly option for short distance travel. 

\subsection{Problem Definition}

Aside from select innovative exceptions, current methods of electric personal transport are limited in both mechanics and utility by an adherence to more traditional form factors including the skateboard and bicycle. 
As an example of an alternate transportation system, a full control law for a RipStik will be developed and tested. 
The development of this control law will first require a complete, working mathematical model of the RipStik and a custom tool to visualize the model and control law outputs on a 3D model of the RipStik. 
Simplifications and assumptions will need to be made in order to develop a working model of the system. 
These simplifications and assumptions will be carefully scrutinized to ensure that they do not compromise the ability of the model to be applied to other complex mechanical systems. 
A control system will then be developed to propel the RipStik with consideration to triple bottom line implications, including minimizing power requirements and ensuring operator safety. 
Tradeoffs will be made in the development of the control system to find the optimal system which satisfies the performance constraints of the problem and optimizes triple bottom line impact. 

\subsection{Technical Background}
A number of mathematical tools were utilized to develop the framework necessary for the mathematical modelling and control of the RipStik.

\subsubsection{Euler Angles}

Euler angles were introduced to describe the orientation of a body in an inertial reference frame.
These orientations were represented by rotations of three angles; yaw ($\theta$), pitch ($\psi$), and roll ($\alpha$).
With the Euler angles defined, rotation matrices can then be created for the bodies of a system.

A rotation matrix can be defined in the following way \cite{Lewis}:

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:RotM}
R =
\begin{bmatrix} 
\cos\alpha\cos\psi & \cos\alpha\sin\psi\sin\theta - \cos\theta\sin\alpha &\cos\alpha\cos\theta\sin\psi+\sin\alpha\sin\theta\\
\cos\psi\sin\alpha & \cos\alpha\cos\theta+\sin\alpha\sin\psi\sin\theta & \cos\theta\sin\alpha\sin\psi - \cos\alpha\sin\theta\\
-\sin\psi & \cos\psi\sin\theta & \cos\psi\cos\theta 
\end{bmatrix}
\end{equation}

The rotation matrix R can be used to describe a rotation from a body-fixed frame to the inertial frame \cite{VTOL}.

\subsubsection{Lagrangian Mechanics}

Lagrangian mechanics can be used in place of Newtonian mechanics when trying to accurately model highly complex systems.
In these elaborate systems, constraint forces can be implemented to eliminate degrees of freedom and reduce the complexity of the system \cite{LagrangeEquations}. Additionally, Lagrangian equations are invariant to changes of coordinate systems \cite{LagrangePowerpoint}.
\par
The Lagrangian function is represented by L, and is defined as the difference between kinetic and potential energies in a system modeled using positions and velocities \cite{NonholonomicPowerpoint}.
In the equation, T represents the kinetic energy and V represents the potential energy.
The mathematica formulation for the Lagrangian follows:

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:Lagrange}
L = T - V
\end{equation}

\subsubsection{Euler-Lagrange Equations}

The Lagrangian can then be applied to the Euler-Lagrange equations to solve for the equations of motion in the system. 
A mathematical representation of the Euler-Lagrange equations follows:

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:EL}
\frac{\text{d}}{\text{dt}} \bigg(\frac{\partial \text{L}}{\partial \dot{\text{q}}_{i}}\bigg) - \frac{\partial \text{L}}{\partial \text{q}_{i}} = 0
\end{equation}
The Euler-Lagrange equations are equivalent to Newton's second law \cite{NonholonomicPowerpoint}, and are implicit second-order differential equations applied to a given coordinate system \cite{Lewis}.
\par
The unconstrained equations of motion encompass each degree of freedom in the system, and are of the following form:

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:UEOM}
G_{jk} \ddot{q}^k + \Gamma_{jkl} \dot{q}^k\dot{q}^l  = F_{j}
\end{equation}

In Equation \ref{eq:UEOM}, $G_{jk}$ represents the acceleration coefficients of the system, $\Gamma_{jk}$ represents the velocity coefficients of the system, and $F_j$ represents the potential forces of the system.

\subsubsection{Nonholonomic Constraints}

Nonholonomic constraints can be implemented to restrict velocities in a system \cite{LagrangeEquations}.
Lagrange multipliers can be added to the unconstrained equations of motion to represent unknown constraint forces \cite{ClassicalMechanics}.
\par
The forces can then be determined from the following system of equations:

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:CFE}
G_{jk} \ddot{q}^k + \Gamma_{jkl} \dot{q}^k\dot{q}^l  = \lambda_{a}\omega_{j}^{a} + F_{j}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:CV}
\omega_{j}^{a} \dot{q}^{j} = 0
\end{equation}

Equation \ref{eq:CFE} is identical to the unconstrained equations of motion with the added $\lambda_{a}$ term, representing the constraint forces.
Equation \ref{eq:CV} represents the constrained velocity terms. 
\par
When solving for the constraint forces, the system takes on the form of a Differential Algebraic Equation (DAE).

\subsubsection{Linear Quadratic Regulator Control}
The linear quadratic regulator (LQR) algorithm is a method in control theory used to technique used to determine the optimal control gains for a state feedback controller for a linear system with a quadratic cost function. \textbf{CITE LAB MANUAL OR SOMETHING}

For the purpose of this project, linear control systems $\Sigma$ of the form
\begin{equation}
\dot{x}(t) = Ax(t) + Bu(t)
\end{equation}
where $A \in \R^{m \times m}$ and $B \in \R^{m \times l}$ are considered.
The associated quadratic cost function is then 
\begin{equation}
\eta(u) = \int_{0}^{\infty}x^{T}(t)Qx(t)+u^{T}(t)u(t)dt
\end{equation}
where $Q \in \R^{m \times m}$ is the weighting matrix associated with the degrees of freedom and their derivatives $(q, \dot{q})$ in the system. Note that no weightings are associated with the control inputs at this stage, though they may be necessary when considering the broader design impacts (see section \textbf{FILL IN SECTION REF}). Tuning the cost function weighting matrix $Q$ allows emphasis to be placed on stabilization of certain degrees of freedom to better meet design goals for the particular application.

The optimal control gains $K$ are then computed from
\begin{equation}
K = B^{T}X_{r}
\end{equation}
where  $X_{r}$ is the solution to the continuous algebraic Riccati equation \textbf{CITE MATHEMATICA DOCS FOR RICCATISOLVE}
\begin{equation}
A^{T}X_{r} + X_{r}A - (X_{r}B)(B^{T}X_{r}) + Q = 0.
\end{equation}

\subsection{Literature Review}
\subsubsection{A Nonlinear Mathematical Model for a Bicycle}
To gain a clearer perspective of the overall procedure and concepts involved in modeling a complex mechanical system of this nature, a number of similar mathematical models for other modes of personal transportation were analyzed.
In particular, \textit{A Nonlinear Mathematical Model for a Bicycle} \cite{BikeModel} provides a clear example of establishing the necessary coordinate systems and transformation matrices associated with the interconnections and internal angles within the bicycle.
This model includes the rolling dynamics of the wheels and discusses the minutiae of elements like the wheel crown radius, demonstrating the complexity they add to the model before removing these elements to provide a more manageable model.
The final model is also constructed under the assumption that the rider remains stable and upright, allowing the roll angle of the bicycle to be linearized, further facilitating interpretation of the final modeling results.

\subsubsection{Modeling and Control of Casterboard Robot}
In the paper \textit{Modeling and Control of Casterboard Robot} \cite{CasterboardRobot}, Kinugasa et al. discuss similar concepts and their application in the context of a casterboard, however, the overarching goals and product were distinct from the defined problem.
The group from Osaka University developed a highly simplified model, omitting the problem of stability and simplifying the dynamics of the caster rotation using a holonomic constraint. 
They then used this to develop a locomotion control method for the casterboard before implementing, testing and tuning it on a physical robot constructed to match the geometry of the casterboard.

\subsection{Software Tools}
\subsubsection{Mathematica}
Due to the complex nature of the model and the large number of degrees of freedom needed to accurately model the behavior of the RipStik, a powerful symbolic computation tool is required to derive and manipulate the expressions. 
Mathematica was ultimately selected over other options such as Maple and the Matlab Symbolic toolbox due to the combination of robust symbolic and numeric computation features with easy to use visualization features for graphically displaying the various systems developed over the course of the project.
It also provided equivalent or better performance with thorough documentation and examples compared to competitors.

\subsubsection{Three.JS}
While all of the more simple visualizations were constructed directly in Mathematica, an external tool was constructed to animate the full RipStik system in a more attractive and visually intuitive manner. 
The application is javascript based and operated via the web browser, allowing the user to upload a .csv (comma separated value) file of numeric output from the RipStik simulation and returning an animation of the results on a 3 dimensional RipStik model. 
This allows easy validation of the results by inspection, particularly for complex motions where graphs of the angles and positions may not make the full system behavior immediately obvious.
The process used to generate these animations in the application is shown in Figure \ref{fig:ThreeJsFlow}.

The core of the application is ThreeJS, a javascript WebGL library that allows the 3D model to be loaded from a .mdl file (the set of 3D dimensional points that forms the shape) and .mat file (the colors/materials to be overlaid on the shape) then animated using rotations and translations in a standard Cartesian coordinate system.
