\section{Context and Motivation}

\subsection{Changing Cities}

By 2050, it is projected that 86 \% of the developed world will reside in urban areas \cite{Economist}. 
As a result of the adoption of the motorized vehicle, cities have become increasingly multi-centred, with retail parks and industrial estates far removed from the city centre \cite{SustainableTransport}. 
As a result of the changing layout of modern cities, traditional public transport has been rendered largely ineffective at efficiently transporting the population within the city \cite{SustainableTransport}. 
A British study showed that 83\% of commuting trips and 90\% of business trips in that country involved only a single passenger in a car \cite{NTS}, highlighting that the supply of mass, group transit does not meet the travel demands of modern society.
\\
\\
The lack of effective transportation infrastructure also has a considerable impact on the environment. 
The United States Environmental Protection Agency has determined that 14\% of global emissions are as a result of the transportation sector \cite{EPA}. 
Meanwhile, a Belgian case study showed that 47\% of trips and 54\% of distance travelled in that country was for the purpose of urban commuting \cite{Belgium}. 
Clearly, the environmental impact of urban transportation is considerable.

It has been determined that an effective transportation system for a modern city must satisfy the following constraints \cite{SustainableTransport}:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item is available on demand
	\item goes non-stop from start to destination
	\item is easily accessible and offers a full choice of destinations
	\item is strongly environmentally friendly
	\item is low cost
	\item integrates well with other forms of transport
	\item has demonstrably high safety together with personal security
\end{enumerate}

Personal electric transport (PET) has the potential to satisfy the transportation demands of a modern city. 
PET is user operated, meaning it is indeed available on demand and is accessible. 
Additionally, it is inherently portable and thus integrates well with other forms of transport. 
Using an appropriate power source will ensure that the PET device can travel non-stop to and from a multitude of destinations at a low cost. 
In order to ensure personal security and safety, it is imperative that the PET device have a stabilizing mechanism governed by control law. 
A RipStik makes for an ideal candidate in the study of control law for complex mechanical systems for use in personal electric transport. 

\subsection{The RipStik}

A caster board, known commercially as a RipStik, is a two-wheeled, human powered vehicle. 
The board is similar to a skateboard; however, it features two platforms, each with a wheel connected to an inclined free spinning caster. 
These platforms are connected by a torsion bar. 
This gives the caster board rider the unique ability to generate propulsion without removing their feet from the board through a series of small turns. 
This configuration also allows for tighter turning and more responsive speed control when compared to a skateboard.

Developing an electronic control system for the RipStik could facilitate riding, reducing the learning curve associated with the board while preserving the advantages of the vehicle.
However, a RipStik is a sophisticated mechanical system and will require complex mathematical modelling to understand and represent all forces present in the system at a given time. 
As a result, comprehensive testing and design metrics are required as there are no implicit assumptions to be made about the device's operation. 
The technology developed in modelling and controlling the RipStik can be applied to a large variety of systems. 

The addition of a control system to a complex mechanical system presents the potential for significant conflicts. 
Aside from the challenges associated with the development of the mathematical model and control system, issues pertaining to the patents for transport systems \cite{casterboardPatent} and restricted operation of certain devices \cite{TOLaws} may represent a barrier in bringing theses products to market. 
Additionally, a mechanical system will be required to execute the commands of the control system. 
The difficulties associated with the recycling of batteries \cite{BatteryRecharge}, housing \cite{PlasticAssessment} and motors may threaten the environmental feasibility of the final design. 
The system may also be susceptible to "hacking" by outside sources \cite{DEFCON}, which could pose a significant safety risk to the operator. 
If these issues are addressed and mitigated, the potential of the device to minimize injuries associated with operating complex mechanical systems and to serve as a viable alternative to motor vehicles can be realized. 
This area of study has the potential to redefine urban commuting across the world by introducing a safe, cost-effective and environmentally-friendly option for short distance travel.
