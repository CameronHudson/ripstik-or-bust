\section{Problem Definition}

Aside from select innovative exceptions, current methods of electric personal transport are limited in both mechanics and utility by an adherence to more traditional form factors including the skateboard and bicycle. As an example of an alternate transportation system, a full control law for a Ripstik will be developed and tested. The development of this control law will first require a complete, working mathematical model of the Ripstik and a custom tool to visualize the model and control law outputs on a 3D model of the Ripstik. Conclusions will then be drawn about the merits and drawbacks of such a system, with careful consideration for the mechanical, social, environmental and economic implications of such a device.
