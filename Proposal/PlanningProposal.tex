\section{Planning}
\subsection{Group Breakdown}
When dividing work up among the group members, all involved will contribute to all aspects of the project. Technical leads have been established for the various facets of the project to ensure needs are evenly addressed and guide overall direction for tasks. The individual in charge of a given task will not work alone on the task, rather, they ensure the needs of the task are being addressed via combined contributions from all group members. 
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Benjamin Rudson}: Project Lead, responsible for managing the overall project timeline, in particular ensuring that all triple bottom line concerns have been addressed. 
\item \textbf{Andrew Cantanna}: R\& D, Responsible for research and development of the mathematical model and control system. 
\item \textbf{Cameron Hudson}: QA Lead, Responsible for the 3D model visualization, code review and overall quality assurance/testing.
\end{itemize}
All distributed tasks are based on an idealized schedule and are subject to change based on progress made by the group.

\subsection{Gantt Chart}
The Gantt chart, shown in Figure \ref{fig:gantt}, lays out the anticipated project schedule based on the week of the academic year (weeks 1-12 being semester 1, 13-34 being semester 2) in which the task will be worked on. This timeline is likely to change through the year but provides a broad framework for what is required to completely finish by the intended date. Weekly updates on task status will be provided to the project supervisor during a meeting Friday at 10:30 AM, with a summary email by 4:30 PM the same day.
